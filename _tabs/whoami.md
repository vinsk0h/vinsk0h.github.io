## 👋 What's my story?
- I've always been someone with a wide range of interests, which often led me to explore many different things rather than sticking to just one for a long time.

- 🔥 After wasting quite a bit of time procrastinating, I realized that I had wasted way too much time spending all my time on video games.... I thought it was high time to take action
## Objective
I've set myself a clear objective: to progress in cybersecurity and build up my skills, step by step. I want to deepen my knowledge of defense, forensics and threat hunting, while continuing to take certifications to validate my learning. But beyond diplomas, what drives me is discovery and challenge. I love digging, understanding, analyzing... and if I can share my experiences and help others to move forward, that's even better. The aim is to learn while having fun, without taking myself too seriously!
