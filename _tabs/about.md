## 👋 What's my story?
- I was always a person who was very hard to keep the interest in something for more than a month. 

- 🔥 After wasting quite a bit of time procrastinating, I realized that I had wasted way too much time spending all my time on video games.... I thought it was high time to take action
## Objective
I've set myself a clear objective: to progress in cybersecurity and build up my skills, step by step. I want to deepen my knowledge of defense, forensics and threat hunting, while continuing to take certifications to validate my learning. But beyond diplomas, what drives me is discovery and challenge. I love digging, understanding, analyzing... and if I can share my experiences and help others to move forward, that's even better. The aim is to learn while having fun, without taking myself too seriously!
