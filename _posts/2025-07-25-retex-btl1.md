### Introduction

I'm a SysAdmin for several years now, I was looking for my first cybersecurity certification, which would give me at least one foot in the door. Having received some very positive feedback from my acquaintances on this certification, I decided to go for it.

And I have no regrets... I recommend this certification.

### ü§î What is Blue Team Level One ?

Blue Team Level One is a fairly recent certification released in 2020 by [Security Blue Team](https://securityblue.team/), and is becoming increasingly popular.

A few figures on certification :

* 330+ Lessons, Videos, Activities and Quizzes
    
* 23 LABS (100 hours of use)
    
* 4 months on-demand access to the training material
    
* ¬£399 GBP (Training + **2 Exam vouchers**)
    

Each domain has several labs that you can use to practice and redo several times if you wish.

The six domains covered are shown below :

1. Security Fundamentals
    
2. Phishing Analysis
    
3. Threat Intelligence
    
4. Digital Forensics
    
5. Security Information and Event Monitoring
    
6. Incident Response
    

One of the modules also covers the fundamentals of safety, which are a prerequisite for taking the course.

### üéì And what about the exam ?

The exam lasts 24 hours, you'll be given a series of 20 questions to answer and **you won't have to write a report**. You'll need to pass your exam with at least 70% to be eligible.

Be careful not to underestimate the exam, I went through all the LABS in the course and still encountered a few hurdles during the exam.

Once you've submitted your exam, you'll get the answer **IMMEDIATELY**, as well as feedback on your wrong answers. You will have to wait 10 days if you wish to use your second voucher.

The exam takes the form of a scenario based on a real case where a company appears to have been compromised by malicious actors. It's up to you to find out the truth, and how they did it.

### üí° Tips ?

I recommend that you are comfortable with log analysis and the use of a SIEM. If you want to be well prepared on the use of SIEM I invite you to make [**Boss Of The SOC v1**](https://bots.splunk.com/event/3oQ7sqI5bajOCP43o0svqT/detail)

To all French people, you can finance your BTL1 with your famous CPF through Alphorm (mention that you come from [@Hamza](https://twitter.com/kondah_ha)). The process is a little long (1-2 months) but it will allow you to save your money and use your balance.

### üìö Ressources

[Cyberdefenders](https://cyberdefenders.org/) :

In my opinion, it's the best platform for practicing blue team skills. It can be compared to TryHackMe and HackTheBox for practicing red team skills.

They offer free challenges and Labs for the PRO version.

[Blue Team Labs Online](https://blueteamlabs.online/home) :

A platform similar to Cyberdefender but created by Security Blue Team, the Investigations is very similar to the BTL1 exam format.

[LetsDefend](https://letsdefend.io/)

LetsDefend is also a platform for practicing and improving skills on the blue team side. On the practical side, Letsdefend uses real cyberattacks to get as close as possible to reality.
